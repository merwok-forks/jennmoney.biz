hi so while i have your attention

   i want to talk about some things that you
      probably have heard a lot about over the past
      couple of weeks
      and that have been spinning in my head for some time
      there's a lot on my mind and i've learned a lot
      over the past several months but i don't know
      everything but i'm trying

like how a lot of us are mad and scared
and    ~* nazis are getting punched *~
but still getting book deals and university talk slots

   ---- black lives matter ---
 --- stop killing trans people ---

take away nazi voices with physical and digital force
ur not pro-life if you don't care what happens after birth

       keep your policies out of my vagina
but don't make my vagina a symbol of the movement
  i'm not having the best time with my reproductive health
      at the moment. so i don't really want to identify
                with my vagina. i think i'll be ok? anyway

                  *** not all women have vaginas ***
                 *** #notallmen don't have vaginas ***

                 people deserve a fair wage to live!
                and you cannot claim food stamps and welfare
                  are abused and should be eradicated
                    when corporations see those programs
                   existing as a fair
                   reason not to pay fair wages

               and if those programs go away,
               don't expect them to care lmao jfc

                  low wages and bad food and
                  lack of access to clean water
                       are killing our country
                and it's already past the
                  time to stop ignoring
                   how these are symptoms
                   of systemic racism
                   W H I T E S U P R E M A C Y
                   and lack of care of the poor

                   these are race and class issues

                    IT'S FUCKING 2017

                    pro-life is anti-feminist

    stop arguing about who should have won (bernie) and
     start gathering and making literal noise

      STOP LETTING SILICON VALLEY THINK THEY DRIVE THIS
      COUNTRY IN ANY POSITIVE WAY LOL

      LISTEN TO BLACK WOMEN

      STOP WHITEWASHING AND CIS-WASHING HOLLYWOOD FILMS
      AND ACTIVIST MOVEMENTS

      and if you ever meet a man named bob baron, tell him
     he's a sexist piece of shit and i hope his company's
           product fails. pls like + subscribe

           anyway, this one's called WONDERWALL...
